## Kalman Filter

Kalman Filter, also known as Hidden Markov Model, is a dimensionality reduction model which assumes that data follows an underlying latent linear dynamical system. It projects high dimensional data into a low dimensional represenation while preserving the main features/variables (better known as explanatory variables) which it believes explains the data well. 

## How it works
Kalman Filter provides estimates of unknown variables given the measurements observed over time.
