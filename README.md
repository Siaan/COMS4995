## Kalman Filter

Kalman Filter, also known as Hidden Markov Model, is a dimensionality reduction model which assumes that data follows an underlying latent linear dynamical system. It projects high dimensional data into a low dimensional represenation while preserving the main features/variables (better known as explanatory variables) which it believes explains the data well.
